UART Library for the MSP430 Launchpad
-------------------------------------

To use this library, you must supply a valid "board_support.h" file with:
- definition of TXD and RXD pins: they are bound to TACCR0-1 location, as 
  described earlier. Hint: TACCRx are remapped on more pins, see datasheet.
- definition of your SMCLK_FREQUENCY in Hz(Timer is sourced from SMCLK).
E.g.:

#define TXD             BIT1                // TXD on P1.1
#define RXD             BIT2                // RXD on P1.2
#define SMCLK_FREQUENCY 1000000uL

UART baudrate, LEDs signaling for TX/RX and ringbuffer size and usage
must be set in UART.h


Notes on CPU speed and baudrates
--------------------------------

The maximum baudrate that can be obtained depends on:
-The MCLK/SMCLK clock frequency.
-How close the SMCLK_FREQUENCY value is to the real clock frequency.
-Use or not of the ringbuffer.

In particular, it may be worth re-calibrate the DCOCLK of the microcontroller 
to lower the bit error rate at high baudrates. You can easy do it with a DMM or 
logic analyzer and following instructions in "slau144".

The following combinations have been tested by calibrating the DCOCLK with a
+/- 20kHz accuracy:

--------------------------------------------
| DCOCLK | Ring buffer | baudrate | Result |
--------------------------------------------
|  1MHz  |     yes     |  4800    |  OK    | (Fail at long full-duplex strings)
|  1MHz  |     no      |  9600    |  OK    |
|  1MHz  |     yes     |  9600    |  Fail  |
|  2MHz  |     yes     |  9600    |  OK    |
